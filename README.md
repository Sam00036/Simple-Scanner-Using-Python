# Simple-Scanner-Using-Python
It is my first work in Machine Learning model. Here i use some basic python module and approach to scan an image and save it in file of pdf format. As it is in early stage so it gives a 60-65% accuracy in detection. But in future i will try to make it more effective. You can check the attached photos for the result. Thanks for visiting.
